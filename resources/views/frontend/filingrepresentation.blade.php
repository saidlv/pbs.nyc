                                Department of Building requirements, and for good reason--there isn't much "expediting" going on.
                                Throughout our years of experience, we've learned the DOB codes from front to back, built relationships within the department,
                                and developed efficient procedures for fast and accurate approvals, permits, corrections and sign offs. With your project in our hands, it will actually be expedited.</span>
